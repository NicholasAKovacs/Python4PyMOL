"# Pytbon4PyMOL is a collection of the python scripts I have created or modified. Many of the PyMOL scripts I have modified came from the 'Script Library' on PyMOLwiki.com. My versions just have a bit more options and almost always deal with PyMOL objects. I prefer to use 'objects' rather than 'selections' in PyMOL because I find it easier and it also stresses the utility of Object-Oriented programming."
