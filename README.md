# Python4PyMOL 

A collection of the python scripts I have created or modified. Many of the PyMOL scripts I have modified came from the 'Script Library' on PyMOLwiki.com. My versions have more options in their functions and almost always deal with PyMOL objects. I prefer to use 'objects' rather than 'selections' in PyMOL because I find it easier and it also stresses the utility of Object-Oriented Programming."
